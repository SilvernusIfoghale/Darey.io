<!-- Objective: 
The html-project successfully creates a personal profile page utilizing appropriate semantic HTML elements. The header, navigation menu with list structure, bio section with image and alt text, hobbies list, and footer with contact information all fulfill the requirements.  The image integration is well-handled, with a local image correctly referenced and including descriptive alt text. The structure is clean, semantic, and easy to follow, earning full marks for this assignment.  The navigation menu across the three pages (index.html, about.html, contact.html) provides consistent structure. The content of the about.html and contact.html pages could be more specific to their respective purposes. Consider expanding on the bio in about.html and providing a contact form or more contact options in contact.html. The hobbies listed are relevant but could use expansion or some unique flair as well.
