Mini Project Assessment

Explain why nodejs is powerful for building scalable web applications. and also explain the pros and cons of using nodejs.

Objective
Create a detailed analysis report that explores Node.js's capabilities in building scalable web applications and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages. 

Tasks
1. Research and explain the following aspects of Node.js:
- Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
- Single-threaded event loop architecture
- How Node.js handles concurrent connections
- Role of npm (Node Package Manager)

2. Create a comparison table highlighting Node.js scalability features versus traditional server-side technologies
3. Develop a list of pros and cons for Node.js:

Pros: 
- Explain performance benefits
- Discuss the vast ecosystem of packages.
- Describe the advantage of using JavaScript on both frontend and backend
- Cover real-time capabilities
- Discuss corporate adoption and community support

Cons:
- Address CPU-intensive task limitations
- Discuss callback hell and potential solutions
- Cover issues with error handling
- Explain database query challenges

4. Practical Component: Create a simple scalable web application demonstrating Node.js capabilities.
- Build a real-time chat application OR
- Create a basic API with multiple concurrent connections
- Document the implementation and explain how it showcases Node.js's scalability. 

Deliverables
1. Written Report (1000-1500 words) covering:
- Detailed explanation of Node.js architecture
- Analysis of scalability features
- Comprehensive props and cons list with examples
- Real-world use cases and examples
2. Code Implementation
- Source code for the practical component
- Documentation explaining the implementation 
- Instructions for running the application 
- Performance metrics and Scalability tests
