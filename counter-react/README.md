# Mini Project Assessment: Click Counter App

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple Click Counter application using React state. Users should be able to increase or decrease the count by clicking on respective buttons.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Setting Up the Counter Component

- Create a functional component to manage the counter.
- Use the `useState` hook to store and update the counter value.

### 2. Adding Buttons for User Interaction

- Add an "Increase" button to increment the counter.
- Add a "Decrease" button to decrement the counter.
- Ensure that the counter updates in real-time when buttons are clicked.

### 3. Handling Edge Cases

- Prevent the counter from going below zero (optional).
- Display a message if the counter reaches a certain threshold (e.g., "You've reached the limit").

## Requirements

1. Use **React functional components** with hooks (`useState`).
2. Implement a clean UI with proper styling.
3. Ensure buttons properly update the state on click.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
